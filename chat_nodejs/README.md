Chat Window By Janet
This little project implemented a simple chat demo using Node.Js, BootStrap and  Html5
In the demo I used socket.io to implement most functions.

Features
Multiple users can join a chat room by each entering a unique username on website load.
Users can type chat messages to the chat room and send it by press enter.And aslo when one user typing another user can see it. 
A notification is sent to all users when a user joins or leaves the chatroom.
